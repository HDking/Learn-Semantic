  <h3 class="ui header">What's so great about words</h3>
  <p>Language is a difficult thing to discuss because it is an inperceivable part of our experience of reality, our only vehicle by which we can share meaning. We often even find it useful to communicate ideas internally through language to ourselves, a <em>real me</em> narrating a stream of consciousness like a storybook. Yet even though we enjoy all the benefits of an exchange language for biological information processing machines, we ignore its utility for coding computers, looking to redefine the same principles of languages.</p>
  <p>Even if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_(philosophy_of_mind)">pure functionalism</a> and the talk of humans as being peculiar types of machines makes you want to run and hide in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">far away room</a>, the argument that natural languages are much better equipped to create meaning doesn't necessarily have to be tackled philosophically.</p>
  <p>Many features of natural languages are <a href="http://huh.ideophone.org/">convergent</a>, arising simultenously in different parts of the world with no contact. Natural languages even evolved under similar constraints as programming languages.</p>

  <h3 class="ui header">Twin Brothers</h3>
  <p>Bandwidth plays a critical role in natural languages, being even more restrictive than computer systems. Speaking requiring us to physically contort internal valves in our larynx to modulate the frequency of waves of air pressure, and that's not say anything of the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1315292/">fascinating complexity</a> in our capacity to observe those same modulations.</p>
  <p>Natural languages are also designed to limit not just the lenth of encoding to a collection of sounds, but also to optimially <b>limit the conceptual scope</b> and account for varying implementations.</p>
  <p>Often times the <b>connotations</b> (tech-speak "implementation") may vary from person to person of an idea. <b>Love</b> may connote ideas of romantic love, or in others felings of agape, or specific memories with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia">a quality</a> you only can understand, yet four letters and one sylabble are enough to contain the concept.</p>
  <p>A single idea may also vary from instance to instance. A normal <b>horse</b> might have four legs, but if you encountered a three-legged horse you would find no difficulty considering it a horse. In fact, you may never encounter a three-legged horse, and still might store space for it conceptually based purely on your imagination of the possibility. Or the classic Wittgenstein example of  "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-game_(philosophy)#Description">What is a game?</a>". Natural language can accomodate for these variations in implementation, tempered by a history longer than we even know, and a whole life-time of personal experiences.</p>
  <p>Languages also evolved to define physical concepts into classes, <b>words</b>, which can be used in an exchange of ideas among systems that may include slightly fuzzy definitions</p>


  <p>Individual interface elements are the <b>nouns</b> (tech-speak "classes") which provide a <b>context</b> ("scope") to <b>limit the broadness</b> ("encapsulate") of <b>modifiers</b> ("properties") and <b>behaviors</b> ("methods").</p>
  <p>Natural languages are used today for describing interface design, although they aren't usually considered in the actual process of coding interfaces. Words like <b>popup</b>, <b>dropdown</b>, and <b>modal</b> didn't exist twenty years ago, yet now most people who visit websites understand these as essential elements of a design. They know what to expect from their behavior, how to use them and can distinguish them in a design.</p>

  <h3 class="ui header">Well What is "Everyone Else" Doing?</h3>

  <p>The resolute success industry-wide of "flatening" design: removing gradients and reducing uses of shadows, recanting of skeumorphic design, defining relationships through negative spacing instead of borders, etc. shows there is a directionality to interface languages. We can convey meaning with less <a href="http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/affordances.html">affordances</a> than ever, not primarily because web developers understanding of design has evolved, but because <b>users understanding of design has evolved from years of usage</b>.</p>

  <h2 class="ui header">Tending to Tendencies</h2>
  <p>Classifying, creating rules, naming things are all essential parts of being a programmer. Something we are required to do day after day. Many programmers not only solve complex abstract problems routinely, but spend their free time thinking about the meta-tendencies of solving problems. How can i write this quicker next time? How can I avoid repetitive tasks? How can I abstract this out to be re-used? These are all positive traits individually, but can lead to biases as a field to intellectualize issues.</p>


  <p> There is a fundamental tendency for computer programmers who are <b>innate problem solvers</b> to look for intellectual solutions to problems, to see all problems as solvable using the same techniques which we solve problems inside the curly quotes of programming.</p>

  <p>Simple solutions may not always feel as gratifying as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">complex ones</a>. It is the tendency of scientific thinking to see the current version of truth as the Truth, the current best practices, as the only practice, whether next year they might be disavowed or forgotten for the new big thing. This mania drives forward progress, because many of the <b>new big thing</b> become the <b>old standard</b> soon enough, but still <b>requires programmers to operate under a shared, accepted obsession with the new.</b>.</p>

  <p>This isnt a surprising mania for programmers. Widespread internet usage is only a couple decades old, programming languages only sixty years old. Why is it unrealistic to assume we cant make something dramatically better next year? .</p>

  <p>So where does all this leave us? What practicality can be gleamed from all this convoluted mess?</p>
  <p>For example explaining "size" as a <b>general concept</b> can be very difficult. How can you define smallness <em>in general</em> when a <b>tiny</b> planet is still much larger than a <b>gigantic</b> ant?</p>

  <h3 class="ui header">Drawing Limits</h3>
  <p>It's important to explain, that this argument only applies directly to <b>exchange languages like HTML</b> and not all programming languages. The meat and potato of most programming can be more much more complex. Moods, sentiments, feelingsâ€”the internal "processing languages" of meaning in organic systems can difficult to comprehend, and utterly unaccountable by language.</p>
